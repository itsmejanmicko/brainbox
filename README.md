# BrainBox 

I created this to dive deeper into backend Node.js—but thanks to AI, I’ve picked up some frontend skills along the way! Now I’m kind of like a backend dev with a frontend toolkit... or at least a frontend survival guide!

 Welcome to *Brainbox* 🧠, the world’s first and only shoppe where you won’t find a single thing you actually need, but everything you *never knew you wanted*!

Need a mental upgrade? No problem! Introducing the *BrainChip 2.0*: just pop it in, and boom—now you can multitask like a pro 🕶️. From a modest 128MB for the Monday blues to a whopping 2TB for those marathon coding sprints (goodbye, “Wait…what was I doing?” moments).

Or maybe you’re tired of squinting at code? 👀 Check out *UltraSight HD™*! It’s like laser eye surgery met the zoom button: see code from a mile away in full 4K! Built-in night vision included for those endless late nights.

At Brainbox, we’re here to help you think, blink, and code better than ever! Stop by—we promise not to sell you anything useful 😉.

## Acknowledgements

 - I created this with the help of AI in the frontend—so technically, it’s a human-AI co-production… or maybe AI just did most of the heavy lifting while I supervised with snacks!
 - V0 - I use this ai generation to generate design I polish to make it easy to navigate but I'm not good in frontend RT.
