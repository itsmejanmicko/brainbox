     DESCRIPTION:`   "Introducing Brainbox ‚Äì a wild mix of my genius and a dash of AI magic. The backend? Built entirely with Node.js, powered by the endless possibilities of my own mind (or at least, that's what I tell myself). For the frontend, I whipped up a sleek experience with React and Vite, because who doesn‚Äôt love something fast and responsive? And just when I thought I could do it all myself, I decided to bring in a little help from my AI buddy. It‚Äôs like having an over-caffeinated sidekick who knows all the best code snippets. The result? A powerful app that might just be smarter than me ‚Äì but don‚Äôt tell anyone. üòéüöÄ"`,
